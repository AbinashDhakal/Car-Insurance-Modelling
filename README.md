# Car Insurance Modelling
This GitHub repository focuses on Car Insurance Modelling, utilizing statistical and mathematical models for predicting claim frequency, severity, and total cost. The project involves data analysis, preprocessing, and building a Poisson GLM model. Key findings and outcomes include:

# Findings:
Age of Driver Impact: Older drivers are associated with a significant decrease in the expected number of claims.

Car Age Influence: While there's some indication that older cars might have more claims, it isn't statistically significant in this model.

Region Impact: The model doesn't find statistically significant evidence that being in suburban or urban regions affects the number of claims compared to being in a rural area.

# Outcome:
The developed Poisson GLM model provides insights into the factors influencing car insurance claims.

This information is crucial for insurance companies to optimize pricing, risk management, and overall business strategies.

# Tools Used:
Python
Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data analysis and visualization.
Statsmodels for building the Poisson GLM model.
